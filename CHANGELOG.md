  - Enhanced numpy-style docstring detection with pattern-based recognition
  - Added pattern-based detection that looks for section headers with dashes
    (e.g., `Returns\n-------`) before falling back to size-based comparison

    chars per line
- Added

## [0.6.3] - 2025-03-30

- Added
  - Added `DOC504` and a config option
    `--should-declare-assert-error-if-assert-statement-exists`. If this option
    is True and a function has an `assert` statement, an `AssertError`
    declaration is required in the docstring. Otherwise `DOC504` is raised.

  - Now if a function as an `assert` statement, an `AssertError` declaration is
    by default required in the docstring's "Asserts" section (if relevant
    config options to check raises/assertions are turned on)
- Full diff
  - https://github.com/jsh9/pydoclint/compare/0.6.0...0.6.1

## [0.6.0] - 2025-01-13

- Added
  - A new violation code, `DOC003`, to detect docstring style mismatch (when

- Full diff
  - https://github.com/jsh9/pydoclint/compare/0.5.19...0.6.0

## [0.5.19] - 2025-01-12

- Fixed
  - False positive DOC405 and DOC201 when we have bare return statements
    together with `yield` statements

- Added
  - A new config option `--auto-regenerate-baseline` to automatically
    regenerate the baseline file for every successful _pydoclint_ run
- Full diff
  - https://github.com/jsh9/pydoclint/compare/0.5.16...0.5.17

## [0.5.16] - 2025-01-11

- Added
  - A pre-commit hook for using _pydoclint_ as a flake8 plugin

- Full diff
  - https://github.com/jsh9/pydoclint/compare/0.5.15...0.5.16

## [0.5.15] - 2025-01-10

- Changed
  - Changed to using v0.0.10 of docstring_parser_fork, which now throws a
    `ParseError` when a non-empty docstring section cannot be parsed (in Numpy
    style). This `ParseError` would lead to DOC001.

## [0.5.4] - 2024-07-14

- Added
  - An option `--should-document-private-class-attributes` (if False, private
    class attributes should not appear in the docstring)
  - An option `--treat-property-methods-as-class-attributes` (if True,

- Full diff
  - https://github.com/jsh9/pydoclint/compare/0.5.3...0.5.4

## [0.5.3] - 2024-06-26

## [0.5.1] - 2024-06-24

- Changed
  - Used a dedicated "attribute" section for Sphinx-style docstrings

- Full diff
  - https://github.com/jsh9/pydoclint/compare/0.5.0...0.5.1

## [0.5.0] - 2024-06-22

- Added
  - Added checks for class attributes
    - This functionality checks class attributes against the "Attributes"
      section of the docstring
    - There is a new config option, `--check-class-attributes` (or `-cca`),
      which defaults to `True`. Therefore, this breaks backward compatibility.
    - To maintain backward compatibility, set `--check-class-attributes` to
      `False`
    - Options like `--check-arg-order`, `--arg-type-hints-in-signature`, and
      `--arg-type-hints-in-docstring` are still effective in checking class
      attributes

  - https://github.com/jsh9/pydoclint/compare/0.4.0...0.4.1

## [0.4.0] - 2024-02-08

- Changed
  - Improved the violation message of DOC105: the arguments with inconsistent
    type hints are now shown in the violation message to make violation
    correction much easier

- Full diff
  - https://github.com/jsh9/pydoclint/compare/0.3.10...0.4.0

## [0.3.10] - 2024-02-07

- Added

    parsing Google-style return section

## [0.3.5] - 2023-10-17

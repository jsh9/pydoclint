## [0.3.1] - 2023-08-28

- Added

  - Added an option `--require-yield-section-when-yielding-nothing` (defaulting

    function yields None (https://github.com/jsh9/pydoclint/issues/79)

  - Added handling of functions that both return something and yield something
- Changed
  - Used docstring_parser_fork to parse numpy-style docstrings, because the

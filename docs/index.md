# pydoclint

_Pydoclint_ is a Python docstring linter to check whether a docstring's
sections (arguments, returns, raises, ...) match the function signature or
function implementation.

It runs really fast. In fact, it can be thousands of times faster than
[darglint](https://github.com/terrencepreilly/darglint) (or its maintained fork
[darglint2](https://github.com/akaihola/darglint2)).

Here is a comparison of linting time on some famous Python projects:

|                                                              | pydoclint | darglint                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- | --------------------------------- |
| [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)                      | 2.0 sec   | 49 min 9 sec (1,475x slower)      |
| [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) | 2.4 sec   | 3 hr 5 min 33 sec (4,639x slower) |

Additionally, _pydoclint_ can detect some quite a few style violations that
darglint cannot.

Currently, _pydoclint_ supports three docstring styles:
[numpy](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html),
[Google](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/example_google.html),
and
[Sphinx](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html).

Another note: this linter and [pydocstyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle)
serves complementary purposes. It is recommended that you use both together.

<!--TOC-->

## 1. Installation

To install only the native _pydoclint_ tooling, run this command:

```
pip install pydoclint
```

To use _pydoclint_ as a _flake8_ plugin, please run this command, which will
also install _flake8_ to the current Python environment:

```
pip install pydoclint[flake8]
```

Note that _pydoclint_ currently only supports Python 3.8 and above. (Python 3.7
support may be added if there are interests and requests.)

## 2. Usage

### 2.1. As a native command line tool

```
pydoclint <FILE_OR_FOLDER>
```

Replace `<FILE_OR_FOLDER>` with the file/folder names you want, such as `.`.

### 2.2. As a _flake8_ plugin

Once you install _pydoclint_ you will have also installed _flake8_. Then you
can run:

```
flake8 --select=DOC <FILE_OR_FOLDER>
```

If you don't include `--select=DOC` in your command, _flake8_ will also run
other built-in _flake8_ linters on your code.

### 2.3. Native vs _flake8_

Should you use _pydoclint_ as a native command line tool or a _flake8_ plugin?
Here's comparison:

|                 | Pros                                     | Cons                                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Native tool     | Slightly faster; supports "baseline" [*] | No inline or project-wide omission support right now [**]     |
| _flake8_ plugin | Supports inline or project-wide omission | Slightly slower because other flake8 plugins are run together |

\*) "Baseline" allows you to log the current violation state of your existing
project, making adoption of _pydoclint_ much easier.

\*\*) This feature may be added in the near future

### 2.4. As a pre-commit hook

_pydoclint_ can be use as a [pre-commit hook](https://pre-commit.com/), both in
the "native" mode or as a _flake8_ plugin.

To use it, put the following in your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file:

#### 2.4.1. Native mode

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/jsh9/pydoclint
  rev: <latest_tag>
  hooks:
    - id: pydoclint
      args: [--style=google, --check-return-types=False]
```

(Replace `<latest_tag>` with the latest release tag in
https://github.com/jsh9/pydoclint/releases)

#### 2.4.2. As a _flake8_ plugin

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/jsh9/pydoclint
  rev: <latest_tag>
  hooks:
    - id: pydoclint-flake8
      args: [--style=google, --check-return-types=False]
```

### 2.5. How to configure _pydoclint_

_pydoclint_ offers many
[configuration options](https://jsh9.github.io/pydoclint/config_options.html)
for you to tune it according to your team's style convention and preference.

Please read this page for instructions on configuring _pydoclint_:
[How to configure _pydoclint_](https://jsh9.github.io/pydoclint/how_to_config.html)

### 2.6. How to ignore certain violations in _flake8_ mode

Please read this page:
[How to ignore certain violations](https://jsh9.github.io/pydoclint/how_to_ignore.html)

### 2.7. Additional tips, tricks, and pitfalls

#### 2.7.1. How to _not_ document certain functions?

If you don't write any docstring for a function, _pydoclint_ will not check it.

Also, if you write a docstring with only a description (without the argument
section, the return section, etc.), _pydoclint_ will not check this docstring,
because the `--skip-checking-short-docstrings` is `True` by default. (You can
set it to `False`.)

#### 2.7.2. How to gradually adopt _pydoclint_?

_pydoclint_ provides a "baseline" feature that allows you to log the current
violation state of your existing project. You'll only need to fix new style
violations, and you can fix the "baseline" violations later.

You can use "baseline" with these 3 config options:

- `--baseline`
- `--generate-baseline`
- `--auto-regenerate-baseline`

For more details, please read the
[documentations on these options](https://jsh9.github.io/pydoclint/config_options.html#18---baseline).

#### 2.7.3. Pitfall: default values of arguments

_pydoclint_ does not like adding default values of arguments in the docstring,
even if this style is allowed in the numpy docstring style guide.

For more rationale, please read
[this page](https://jsh9.github.io/pydoclint/notes_for_users.html#3-notes-on-writing-type-hints).

## 3. Style violation codes

_pydoclint_ currently has 7 categories of style violation codes:

- `DOC0xx`: Docstring parsing issues
- `DOC1xx`: Violations about input arguments
- `DOC2xx`: Violations about return argument(s)
- `DOC3xx`: Violations about class docstring and class constructor
- `DOC4xx`: Violations about "yield" statements
- `DOC5xx`: Violations about "raise" statements
- `DOC6xx`: Violations about class attributes

For detailed explanations of each violation code, please read this page:
[_pydoclint_ style violation codes](https://jsh9.github.io/pydoclint/violation_codes.html).

## 4. Additional notes for users

If you'd like to use _pydoclint_ for your project, it is recommended that you
read these additional notes
[here](https://jsh9.github.io/pydoclint/notes_for_users.html).

Specifically, there is a section in the additional notes on how to easily adopt
_pydoclint_ for existing legacy projects.

## 5. Notes for developers

If you'd like to contribute to the code base of _pydoclint_, thank you!

[This guide](https://jsh9.github.io/pydoclint/notes_for_developers.html) can
hopefully help you get familiar with the code base faster.

| `DOC103` | Docstring arguments are different from function arguments. (Or could be other formatting issues: https://jsh9.github.io/pydoclint/violation_codes.html#notes-on-doc103) |
| `DOC104` | Arguments are the same in the docstring and the function signature, but are in a different order.                                                                       |

### Notes on `DOC103`

Other potential causes to `DOC103` include:

- Numpy docstring style requires this style: `arg1 : int` (a space between
  `arg1` and `:`) but people sometimes write `arg1: int`. This will trigger
  `DOC103`.
- In the Google style, writing an `Args:` section without the preceding summary
  will also trigger `DOC103`.

## 2. `DOC2xx`: Violations about return argument(s)

| Code     | Explanation                                                                                          |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DOC201` | Function/method does not have a return section in docstring                                          |
| `DOC202` | Function/method has a return section in docstring, but there are no return statements or annotations |
| `DOC203` | Return type(s) in the docstring not consistent with the return annotation                            |

Note on `DOC201`: Methods with `@property` as its last decorator do not need to
have a return section.

## 3. `DOC3xx`: Violations about class docstring and class constructor

| Code     | Explanation                                                                                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DOC301` | `__init__()` should not have a docstring; please combine it with the docstring of the class             |
| `DOC302` | The class docstring does not need a "Returns" section, because `__init__()` cannot return anything      |
| `DOC303` | The `__init__()` docstring does not need a "Returns" section, because it cannot return anything         |
| `DOC304` | Class docstring has an argument/parameter section; please put it in the `__init__()` docstring          |
| `DOC305` | Class docstring has a "Raises" section; please put it in the `__init__()` docstring                     |
| `DOC306` | The class docstring does not need a "Yields" section, because `__init__()` cannot yield anything        |
| `DOC307` | The `__init__()` docstring does not need a "Yields" section, because `__init__()` cannot yield anything |

## 4. `DOC4xx`: Violations about "yield" statements

| Code     | Explanation                                                                                                                                                 |

| `DOC402` | Function/method has "yield" statements, but the docstring does not have a "Yields" section                                                                  |
| `DOC403` | Function/method has a "Yields" section in the docstring, but there are no "yield" statements, or the return annotation is not a Generator/Iterator/Iterable |
| `DOC404` | The types in the docstring's Yields section and the return annotation in the signature are not consistent                                                   |

## 5. `DOC5xx`: Violations about "raise" statements

| Code     | Explanation                                                                                               |

| `DOC501` | Function/method has "raise" statements, but the docstring does not have a "Raises" section                |

| `DOC503` | Exceptions in the "Raises" section in the docstring do not match those in the function body               |

## 6. `DOC6xx`: Violations about class attributes

| Code     | Explanation                                                                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DOC601` | Class docstring contains fewer class attributes than actual class attributes.     |
| `DOC602` | Class docstring contains more class attributes than in actual class attributes.   |
| `DOC603` | Class docstring attributes are different from actual class attributes.            |
| `DOC604` | Attributes are the same in docstring and class def, but are in a different order. |
| `DOC605` | Attribute names match, but type hints in these attributes do not match            |
